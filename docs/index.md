## Key Features

*   **Domain Generation**: Create computational domains for ADRIA, including spatial clustering and data aggregation.
*   **Data Formatting**: Standardize datasets for degree heating weeks (DHW), connectivity, and coral cover.
*   **Data Store Integration**: Interact with the RRAP M&DS Data Store to download and manage datasets.
*   **GBR Specific Tools**: Specialized workflows for generating Great Barrier Reef (GBR) wide domains.
